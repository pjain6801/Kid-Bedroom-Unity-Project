# Kid-Bedroom-Unity-Project

## What I did
I added furniture to a kids bedroom scene. For example, a bed, sofa, rug, lamp, and more. I created a bouncy ball adding mass, rigbody and physics components to it. Then, I added a ramp for the ball to slide off of. Finally, I created a tower of blocks for the ball to crash into. 

## Result
